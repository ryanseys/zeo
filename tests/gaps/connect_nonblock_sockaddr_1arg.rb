# Socket#connect_nonblock 1-arg form: the packed sockaddr path. Mirrors

# second connect_nonblock after the handshake completes answers 0, in both
# exception modes -- checked against CRuby, including the second connect
# aimed at a different address. Refusal (ECONNREFUSED) raises immediately
# regardless of the option, because refusal is a hard error, not
# "in progress".

# on Linux. That raised IO::EINPROGRESSWaitWritable past a rescue looking only
# for Errno::EISCONN, and the program died mid-test.
