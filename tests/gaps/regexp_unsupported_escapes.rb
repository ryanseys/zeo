# `\K`, `\R`, `\X` and `\p{...}` each mean something here that the engine does
# not do, and as unknown escapes each was its own letter: /\R/ matched an R
# rather than a newline, and /\p{Alpha}/ answered a pattern that asked for a
# letter with the text of the request. Ported from mruby-regexp 2e7e38a80 and
# ef283321f; upstream refuses `\G` and `\g<name>` in the same commit, and both
# are carried here already, so they keep working.
