# The backtracking engine recursed at every fork, so the C stack was the
# backtracking stack and a recursion ceiling was what kept a long subject from
# overflowing it. A greedy repetition forks once per iteration whatever its
# body holds, so that ceiling was reached by the LENGTH OF THE RUN and not by
# the nesting of the pattern: `\A(a+)b\1\z/` answered nil on a subject that is
# nothing out of the ordinary, once it passed the ceiling.
#
# The state is on the heap now, as choice points and an undo log. The ceiling
# that remains counts entries of that stack rather than C frames, so what it
# bounds is the memory one search asks for.
