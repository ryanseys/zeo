# An empty `{}` local whose `[]=` key is a block's return value.
#
# The key-context pass runs during the fixpoint, where a key that is a block
# result has no type yet, so the local fell through to the post-fixpoint
# backstop -- which defaulted it to StrPolyHash. Codegen reads a StrPolyHash
# key out of the boxed value as `.v.s`, so the write handed a boxed Integer to
# a `const char *` slot and the program segfaulted with no output.
#
# The backstop now checks the local's own `[]=` keys, which by then DO have a
# type, and only keeps the String-keyed default when the key is a String (or
# there are no writes to say otherwise).
#
# Only the receiver form varied: `Rel.new.group { }` was always correct,
# `x = Rel.new; x.group { }` was the crash.
