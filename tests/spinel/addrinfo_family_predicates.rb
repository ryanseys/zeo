# Addrinfo's family predicates compared their (heap) afname against a bare C
# literal through sp_str_eq, which confirms a strcmp hit by comparing byte
# lengths -- and taking a bare literal's length reads its out-of-bounds s[-1]
# marker. Whatever byte precedes the literal in rodata decides: land on a
# marker value and the predicate answers false for two equal names. The rodata
# layout is the optimizer's choice, so the answer changed between -O0 and -O1.
