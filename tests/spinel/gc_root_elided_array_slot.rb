# A poly local proven to hold only a poly array or nil does not need a GC root:
# its index read takes the runtime's inline array arm, which neither allocates
# nor re-enters Ruby, so the element stays reachable from the container it was
# read out of. Codegen drops the root for that local, which is what lets the
# C compiler keep it in a register. The shape below is optcarrot's sprite map:
# a nil-filled table whose entries are handed out of a preallocated buffer.
