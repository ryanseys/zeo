# === poly_recv_dispatch_includes_subclasses ===
# Polymorphic-receiver dispatch must include subclass arms when the
# ivar's observed types narrow to a base class but the runtime value
# may be a subclass instance written via a typed setter. Without this
# the dispatch loop only emits the base-class arm and a subclass
# override is silently skipped — the #616 filter-elision shape (tep's
# `app.@before_filter.before(req, res)` where the override never
# fires because @before_filter is declared `Tep::Filter` but the
# stored runtime value is `TepFilters_before`).

# === poly_recv_dispatch_narrow ===
# #513. When `obj.run(arg)` virtual-dispatched through an
# unpinned receiver slot, the generated cls_id switch
# enumerated EVERY class that defines `run`, not just classes
# that can reach the receiver. Unrelated classes that share
# the method name got pulled into the switch and their
# parameters were widened to sp_RbVal to accept the dispatch
# site's arg.
#
# Fix: when scan_new_calls' poly-recv widening fires for
# `recv.mname(...)` and the recv is an ivar read, compute the
# observed-class set for that ivar via observed_class_ids_for_recv.
# When the recorded observation is just "poly" (because the rhs
# of `@x = w` was a poly-typed param), walk the class's call
# sites for the enclosing method and aggregate the concrete
# obj types observed at the matching arg position. Restrict
# the per-class param-widening loop to that set.
#
# The codegen-side cls_id-switch then naturally drops the
# unrelated arms via the existing arm_incompat check: classes
# whose `run` param stayed at the original concrete type can't
# accept the dispatch site's (different concrete) arg, so the
# arm is suppressed.

# The fix: T_poly_recv_dispatch_narrow_Server#run's `port` stays mrb_int (not widened to
# sp_RbVal by the @w.run(item) dispatch), so the int arithmetic
# `port + 1` compiles cleanly and the direct call

# === poly_recv_each ===
# `<poly>.each` runtime dispatch on cls_id. The compile_each_block
# handler previously bailed when the receiver type was `poly` (no
# matching `if rt == "..."` branch), so a method body that ends in
# `iterable.each do |a| ... end` over a poly slot silently dropped
# the iteration.
#
# Repro: an ivar `@store` widened to poly via two distinct array
# shapes (an int_array and a poly_array) is iterated via `.each`.
# Spinel previously emitted no loop at all — the body never ran.
# The block param `a` is delivered as sp_RbVal (the widest fit
# across the cls_id arms).

# === poly_recv_ivar_narrow_drops_unrelated ===
# Poly-recv user-class dispatch on an ivar previously dragged in
# arms for any class that happened to share the method name, even
# when that class was never assigned to the ivar (never even
# instantiated). Issue #575: an unrelated `run` method on
# T_poly_recv_ivar_narrow_drops_unrelated_Unrelated leaked into the @worker dispatch and forced the
# result temp to widen to sp_RbVal, breaking the downstream
# typed-string consumer.
#
# Fix has two parts:
#   (a) compile_poly_method_call's emit loop consults the existing
#       poly_dispatch_narrow_class_set helper (it was already
#       used by the return-type union but missing from the arm
#       emit).
#   (b) A new analyzer pass forward-propagates each `<C>.new(args)`
#       callsite's arg types into the ivar observations for any
#       `@ivar = pname` write in C#initialize, so the narrow set
#       isn't blocked by the param-union "poly" entry that the
#       writer-scan would have recorded.

# === poly_recv_setter_widens_ivar ===
# #579 (Sam Ruby). `recv.attr = val` where `recv` is statically
# poly (typed sp_RbVal because it came from `case ... when X
# then T_poly_recv_setter_widens_ivar_A.new; when Y then T_poly_recv_setter_widens_ivar_B.new`) lowers to a cls_id-switch
# dispatch in codegen -- each arm does `((sp_C *)_t.v.p)->iv_x = rhs`.
# The analyzer's ivar-type pass only observed setters when recv
# was a single obj_X type; for poly-recv setters every candidate
# class's iv_x stayed at whatever its initialize-time default
# typed it as (e.g. `@data = {}` → sp_StrIntHash *). The per-arm
# assignment then mismatched the wider RHS at the C boundary.
#
# Fix: when scan_writer_calls sees `recv.attr = val` with recv_t
# == "poly", iterate every class that declares the matching
# attr_writer and call update_ivar_type on each. Mirrors the
# codegen dispatch's behavior: every candidate class receives
# the assignment at runtime, so every candidate's ivar type
# must widen against the RHS.
