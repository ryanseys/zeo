# An unresolved qualified constant (`Mylib::VERSION`, Mylib undefined) degrades
# to a rescuable runtime NameError rather than emitting a bare `Mylib_VERSION` C
# identifier (undeclared -> C compile error). The constant would once have come
# from `require "mylib/version"`, but under SPINEL_REQUIRE_GATE an unsatisfiable
# require is itself a compile error, so the realistic program just references the
# constant; the rescuable-NameError behaviour is what matters here.
