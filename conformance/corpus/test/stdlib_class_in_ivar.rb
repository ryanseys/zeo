# A `.new` on a stdlib class Spinel does not implement (Pathname, OpenStruct,
# IPAddr, ...) used to silently degrade to an inert 0 -- the object's methods
# then returned nil, so a program that actually used it diverged from CRuby with
# no signal. It now raises NameError instead: if it can't work, it fails loudly.
#
# A class Spinel models as a no-op (Mutex, single-threaded) and user-defined
# classes are unaffected. The ivar slot still compiles either way (the raise
# expression is int-typed, so no undeclared `sp_<Class> *` field is emitted).
#
# pathname/ostruct/ipaddr are unimplemented stdlib: under SPINEL_REQUIRE_GATE the
# `require` itself is a compile error, so a real program omits it and the .new
# still raises NameError at the use site. Mutex is core (no require needed).
