# === method_name_collision_multi_class ===
# Issue #407 case 2/3. Multiple unrelated classes define the
# same method name; cross-class poly-recv widening picks the
# correct param types via arity match.
#
# Pre-fix the scan_new_calls' forward-ref widening at line
# 9910 bailed when more than one user class defined the same
# `mname` (matched_ci_fwd = -2 = ambiguous), leaving every
# candidate's params at the int default. Heterogeneous-array
# iteration (`[T_method_name_collision_multi_class_IndexHandler.new, T_method_name_collision_multi_class_UsersHandler.new].each |h|;
# h.handle(req, res); end`) then C-compiled with
# `T_method_name_collision_multi_class_IndexHandler#handle(int, int)` against a `"/"` arg ->
# Wint-conversion error.
#
# Fix: when the recv is statically `int`/unresolved
# (var-type-table-not-yet-populated case matz called out),
# walk every user class with the method and widen the ones
# whose ptypes count matches the call's arg count. The arity
# filter excludes attr_accessor entries (0-param getters)
# that happen to share the name with a multi-arg def.
#
# Coverage:
#   - Two unrelated classes (Index/T_method_name_collision_multi_class_UsersHandler) define
#     `handle(req, res)` -- both get widened to (string, string)
#     from the heterogeneous-array iteration's "/" + "" call site.
#   - A third class (T_method_name_collision_multi_class_SQLite) has `attr_accessor :handle` (a
#     0-param getter). Its ptypes count (0) doesn't match the
#     call's arg count (2), so the arity filter excludes it
#     from the widening.
#   - The T_method_name_collision_multi_class_SQLite attr_accessor path is still reachable via
#     `db.handle` (0-arg call) and returns the ivar value
#     unchanged.

# === method_named_log_no_math_collision ===
# Method names that collide with Math module functions (log, sin,
# cos, sqrt, exp, atan2, hypot, ...) should not be misinferred as
# float-returning. Previously, infer_math_and_misc_type blindly
# matched on the method name and returned float regardless of the
# receiver — so a `def log; @log; end` accessor on a non-Math
# class typed callers' locals as float and the downstream
# `obj.log[i]` index emit dispatched as float (bit access). Fix:
# gate the Math.<fn> branch on `recv` being either the literal
# Math module ConstantReadNode or absent.

class T_method_named_log_no_math_collision_Notebook

    @log = []

# === method_param_unify_to_poly ===
# Disagreeing call-site types for the same parameter need to widen
# to `poly`. Pre-fix, `scan_new_calls` (obj-recv) and
# `scan_cls_method_calls` (self-call inside the same class) both
# only widened FROM "int": once the first non-int call site set the
# param type, subsequent disagreeing calls were silently accepted
# and the C compiler rejected the eventual mismatched call.
#
# Once the param widens to `poly`, the int / pointer / etc. arguments
# at the call sites need to be boxed via `sp_box_*`. That boxing
# branch was also missing from `compile_typed_call_args`, so even
# after unify produced "poly", the call sites still passed raw
# mrb_int / pointers to a sp_RbVal-typed parameter.

# === method_redefinition_warning ===
# Issue #667: spinel is an AOT compiler with static dispatch; method
# redefinition is a documented subset limitation. The analyzer detects
# the case in append_cls_meth and emits a stderr warning, then follows
# "last def wins" semantics (matching class reopen for new methods).
# This test verifies the program compiles and runs with the warning
# emitted; full CRuby semantics ("original" then "redefined") would
# require source-order call-site versioning, which is a separate
# multi-day effort.

# === multi_arg_block_call ===
# Multi-argument `block.call(a, b, ...)` on the proc-object path.
#
# Pre-fix, `compile_proc_literal` hardcoded the lambda's signature
# as `static mrb_int <fn>(void *_cap, mrb_int lv_<bp>)` — a single
# `mrb_int` slot — and the call site always lowered to
# `sp_proc_call(lv_<rname>, <arg0>)`, so any second/third positional
# arg was silently dropped.
#
# Fix collects every block param at proc-literal time and emits
# `(void *_cap, mrb_int lv_<bp1>, mrb_int lv_<bp2>, ...)`, then
# dispatches the call site to `sp_proc_call_N` (added to the
# runtime: cast the stored function pointer to the matching N-arg
# signature and invoke).
#
# Out of scope: arity-mismatched calls (`proc { |a| } .call(1, 2)`)
# stay UB on the C side. Spinel's static dispatch enforces match in
# the test cases below.

# 1. Basic: forwarded `&block` invoked with 2 args.

# 4. 0-param block called with one arg. Extra arg is silently dropped
# (matches CRuby semantics). Exercises the `_unused` fallback path
# that the multi-param refactor must leave intact.
